          My research focuses on probing the dynamics of polaron formation in all-inorganic perovskites using ultrabroadband terahertz spectroscopy
          Involves extensive experimental work on an optical table, including the construction of a state-of-the-art THz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and Time-Resolved Terahertz Spectroscopy (TRTS) setup.
          Analyzing the impact of polaron dynamics on charge carrier mobility and scattering, with the goal of improving the design of optoelectronic materials for energy conversion.
          Operate various time-resolved systems, including an all air-plasma THz spectrometer with sub-50 fs and sub-meV resolution.

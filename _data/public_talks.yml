- title: "Exploring Exoplanets: A Panel Discussion"
  speaker: "Jonathan Gagné, Casey Brinkman"
  date: "January 14th, 2026"
  location: "Université de Montréal"
  description: "This panel discussion brought together Jonathan Gagné, Professor at the Université de Montréal, and Casey Brinkman, Postdoctoral Fellow at the Trottier Space Institute, for two complementary talks on exoplanet science. One talk focused on free-floating planets and the diversity and complexity of their atmospheres, while the other explored how exoplanets can mirror the chemical compositions of their host stars. The event concluded with a 30-minute Q&A session, offering ample opportunity for discussion and questions on recent breakthroughs and the current state of exoplanet research."

- title: "Life on Earth & Beyond Panel"
  speaker: "Professor Nagissa Mahmoudi, Professor Richard Léveillé"
  date: "May 1st, 2024"
  location: "McGill University"
  description: "In May 2025, I organized a public panel discussion exploring how studying life on Earth can inform the search for life beyond our planet. Nagissa Mahmoudi, Professor in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at McGill University, took us back billions of years to explore how Earth’s earliest microbes emerged, adapted, and fundamentally transformed our planet’s chemistry—creating the oxygen we breathe and shaping the path of evolution. Richard Léveillé, also a professor in the same department, examined how discoveries from recent space missions—ranging from Mars to the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn—have revealed environments that may support life. His talk addressed the central question: How close are we to discovering life in our Solar System? The evening ended with a Q&A session that sparked thought-provoking conversations with the audience—a truly inspiring event that blended Earth science, space exploration, and curiosity about our place in the cosmos."

- title: "Digital Skies for Ancient Contexts"
  speaker: "J. Luna Zagorac"
  date: "December 4th, 2025"
  location: "McGill University"
  description: "In this talk, J. Luna Zagorac explored how ancient Egyptian star charts, painted on tomb ceilings more than 3,000 years ago, can be interpreted using modern computational tools. Using decanOpy, a Python-based code developed for this project, she digitally reconstructed the night sky around 1300 BCE to investigate how Ramesside Star Clocks were created and what they reveal about early astronomical practices. By matching these digital reconstructions to primary sources, the work aims to shed light on how ancient observations were performed and how ancient star names may correspond to modern constellations."

- title: "Arctic Climate Change"
  speaker: "Bruno Tremblay"
  date: "October 28th, 2025"
  location: "McGill University"
  description: "This talk examined the rapid warming of the Arctic, which is occurring approximately four times faster than the global average. Bruno Tremblay discussed key observations of declining sea ice extent, thickness, and seasonality since satellite monitoring began in the late 1970s. The presentation explored the drivers of Arctic warming, distinguishing natural variability from human-driven climate change, and highlighted the consequences for Arctic ecosystems, local communities, and regions far beyond the North. Particular emphasis was placed on how the Arctic’s response to climate change differs dramatically from that of Antarctica."

- title: "The Flight of the HELIX: Measuring the Galaxy from 40 km Above Greenland"
  speaker: "David Hanna"
  date: "October 9th, 2025"
  location: "McGill University"
  description: "In this talk, Professor David Hanna introduced the High-Energy Light Isotope eXperiment (HELIX), a balloon-borne particle detector designed to measure cosmic rays confined to the Milky Way by its magnetic field. He explained how measuring the abundance ratio of unstable ¹⁰Be to stable ⁹Be can provide insight into the size and structure of the Galaxy’s magnetic field. The presentation covered the technologies behind the two-tonne superconducting spectrometer and focused on HELIX’s first flight, which took place from Kiruna, Sweden to Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, between May 28 and June 3, 2024."

- title: "Quantum Science and Technology Panel"
  speaker: "Professor Bill Coish, Professor Claude Crépeau"
  date: "March 30th, 2024"
  location: "McGill University"
  description: "To celebrate the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology, I organized a public panel in 2025 exploring how quantum ideas are shaping the future of computing, communication, and privacy. The event featured two TED-style talks that gave the audience a chance to dive into both the theoretical promise and real-world implications of quantum technologies. Professor Bill Coish (McGill University) opened the panel with a deep look at quantum hardware and networks—technologies that could not only revolutionize how we compute, but also how we communicate securely. He explored how quantum networks might be key to scaling quantum computers and protecting information from the very power of quantum decryption itself. Next, Professor Claude Crépeau (ÉTS) took a more philosophical and historical angle, reflecting on the decades-long interplay between quantum information and privacy—two concepts that have both clashed and converged in Montreal since the 1980s. His insider perspective offered both caution and optimism about how quantum technologies are shaping a new era of privacy, with stakes ranging from medical data to online banking. The panel concluded with an engaging Q&A session where the audience brought insightful questions about the future of quantum tech, ethics, and its societal impact."

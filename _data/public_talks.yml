- title: "Life on Earth & Beyond Panel"
  speaker: "Professor Nagissa Mahmoudi, Professor Richard Léveillé"
  date: "May 1st, 2024"
  location: "McGill University"
  description: "In May 2025, I organized a public panel discussion exploring how studying life on Earth can inform the search for life beyond our planet. Nagissa Mahmoudi, Professor in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at McGill University, took us back billions of years to explore how Earth’s earliest microbes emerged, adapted, and fundamentally transformed our planet’s chemistry—creating the oxygen we breathe and shaping the path of evolution. Richard Léveillé, also a professor in the same department, examined how discoveries from recent space missions—ranging from Mars to the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn—have revealed environments that may support life. His talk addressed the central question: How close are we to discovering life in our Solar System? The evening ended with a Q&A session that sparked thought-provoking conversations with the audience—a truly inspiring event that blended Earth science, space exploration, and curiosity about our place in the cosmos."

- title: "Quantum Science and Technology Panel"
  speaker: "Professor Bill Coish, Professor Claude Crépeau"
  date: "March 30th, 2024"
  location: "McGill University"
  description: "To celebrate the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology, I organized a public panel in 2025 exploring how quantum ideas are shaping the future of computing, communication, and privacy. The event featured two TED-style talks that gave the audience a chance to dive into both the theoretical promise and real-world implications of quantum technologies. Professor Bill Coish (McGill University) opened the panel with a deep look at quantum hardware and networks—technologies that could not only revolutionize how we compute, but also how we communicate securely. He explored how quantum networks might be key to scaling quantum computers and protecting information from the very power of quantum decryption itself. Next, Professor Claude Crépeau (ÉTS) took a more philosophical and historical angle, reflecting on the decades-long interplay between quantum information and privacy—two concepts that have both clashed and converged in Montreal since the 1980s. His insider perspective offered both caution and optimism about how quantum technologies are shaping a new era of privacy, with stakes ranging from medical data to online banking. The panel concluded with an engaging Q&A session where the audience brought insightful questions about the future of quantum tech, ethics, and its societal impact."

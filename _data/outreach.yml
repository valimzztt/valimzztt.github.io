- title: "24 Hours Of Science"
  date: "October 4, 2025"
  description: "On October 4th, TSI and McGill Physics Outreach teamed up with Science pour tous to host 'Sea to Space', an engaging outreach event for over 200 local students in Montreal. The event aimed to inspire young minds by showcasing the wonders of physics and space science through interactive exhibits and hands-on activities. The event was designed for children aged 5 to 12 and featured creative stations such as building with LEGO, making circuits with the potato lamp experiment, drawing and imagining alien worlds, and crafting models of distant planetary systems. The combination of creativity, play, and science made the day an exciting opportunity for kids to explore how physics connects the deep sea to the farthest reaches of space."

- title: "Q-SITE Conference"
  date: "September 27, 2024"
  description: "I served as the Marketing Director for the Q-SITE Conference, an annual student-led event that brings together students, researchers, and industry professionals to explore the latest developments in quantum science and technology. Having been part of the organizing team the year before, I was especially excited to help build on the momentum of the very first edition of the conference, which launched in Vancouver in 2023. In this role, I contributed to shaping the conference’s identity and outreach, helping create an engaging and welcoming platform for keynote talks, panel discussions, and networking opportunities. Being involved in Q-SITE allowed me to combine my passion for quantum science with science communication and community-building, and to help foster meaningful connections and idea-sharing within the quantum community."

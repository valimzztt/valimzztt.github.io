  description: "On October 4th, TSI and McGill Physics Outreach teamed up with Science pour tous to host 'Sea to Space', an engaging outreach event for over 200 local students in Montreal. The event aimed to inspire young minds by showcasing the wonders of physics and space science through interactive exhibits and hands-on activities. The event was designed for children aged 5 to 12 and featured creative stations such as building with LEGO, making circuits with the potato lamp experiment, drawing and imagining alien worlds, and crafting models of distant planetary systems. The combination of creativity, play, and science made the day an exciting opportunity for kids to explore how physics connects the deep sea to the farthest reaches of space."

abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) is an essential building block for modern theoretical physics, chemistry, and engineering, especially those concerning electronic properties. Through decades of development, various program packages for first-principles electronic structure calculation are now available. Their sophisticated interfaces allow users to apply DFT to actual systems, even without knowing the theory. It is hence becoming more and more important to recall the fundamentals of how DFT enables accurate calculations. This article attempts to provide such knowledge with a minimal overview of DFT—its basic foundation, relations to observable electronic and nuclear dynamical properties, and some of its cutting-edge applications.}

We will discuss: (a) partial occupancies within the framework of the linear tetrahedron method and the finite temperature density-functional theory, (b) iterative methods for the diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian and a discussion of an efficient iterative method based on the ideas of Pulay's residual minimization, which is close to an order Natoms2 scaling even for relatively large systems, (c) efficient Broyden-like and Pulay-like mixing methods for the charge density including a new special ‘preconditioning’ optimized for a plane-wave basis set, (d) conjugate gradient methods for minimizing the electronic free energy with respect to all degrees of freedom simultaneously. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.}

This week, I had to clean my CdTe sample after noticing some leftover wax and glycerin on the surface. Instead of going at it mechanically, I opted for an ultrasonic bath, which is a satisfying and surprisingly elegant way to clean the sample. 

Ultrasonic cleaning uses high-frequency sound waves (typically 20–40 kHz) to agitate a liquid, creating tiny, rapidly oscillating bubbles that gently lift contaminants off a surface. Watching the sample vibrate in the bath is a nice reminder that even something as routine as cleaning in the lab relies on well-defined physical principles.

The ultrasonic transducer converts high-frequency sound into mechanical vibrations, which are transmitted through the bath walls into the liquid. This leads to cavitation: the formation and collapse of microscopic bubbles that help dislodge residues from the sample surface without causing damage. A quiet simple, effective, and a good example of applied physics quietly doing its job, right?

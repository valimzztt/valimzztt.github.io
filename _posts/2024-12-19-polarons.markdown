## Introduction

Polarons are fermionic quasiparticles formed in polarizable materials—such as ionic crystals or polar semiconductors—through the coupling of excess electrons or holes with ionic vibrations. These entities play a significant role in determining materials' properties and functionalities.

The concept dates back to 1933 when Lev Landau described an electron being trapped by lattice distortions. The term “polaron” was coined later in 1946 by Solomon Pekar, who described a charge carrier localized in a self-generated potential well.

### Properties of Polarons

Landau’s insight challenged earlier models that treated electrons and ions independently. In reality, injected charges displace surrounding ions, creating a polarization cloud that forms a composite quasiparticle—an electron (or hole) dressed by virtual phonons. This interaction modifies electron properties like effective mass and energy.

Polarons are thus defined by their:
- **Binding energy** $$E_0 $$
- **Effective mass** $$m^*$$
- **Response to electric and magnetic fields** (e.g., mobility, optical absorption)

### Phonons and Their Role

In polarons, longitudinal optical (LO) phonons are the key lattice vibrations. Phonons are quantized sound waves characterized by wavevector $$ \vec{k} $$, polarization $$ \vec{\xi}$$, and frequency $$ \omega_k$$. They can be transverse or longitudinal, and acoustic or optical—optical phonons are primarily involved in polaron formation.

### Small vs. Large Polarons

- **Large Polarons**: Delocalized wavefunction over many lattice sites; long-range interactions; coherent transport.
- **Small Polarons**: Strong short-range interactions (e.g., in oxides); localized within one unit cell; exhibit thermally-activated hopping transport.

### Small Polarons in Detail

Even in a perfect lattice, electrons can self-localize due to lattice interactions (Holstein coupling). The Holstein model describes this with a 1D chain and a hopping parameter between sites. The model includes:
1. Electron hopping term
2. LO phonon term
3. Short-range electron-phonon interaction term

It cannot be solved exactly but captures the essence of short-range localized polaron formation.

### Fröhlich (Large) Polarons

Developed for electrons interacting with LO phonons under a continuum approximation. Unlike the Holstein model, the Fröhlich model treats the lattice as a polarizable continuum and focuses on long-range electron-phonon coupling.

It uses a Hamiltonian involving:
- Electron kinetic terms
- Phonon creation/annihilation operators
- Interaction terms defined by a coupling constant $$\alpha$$

### Solving the Fröhlich Hamiltonian

Two common variational approaches:
- **Landau-Pekar Method**: Strong coupling regime; adiabatic approximation; classical phonon field.
- **Lee-Low-Pines (LLP) Method**: Weak coupling regime; assumes plane wave electron.

Both methods provide upper bounds for the polaron’s ground state energy.

###  Feynman's Path Integral Approach

Feynman filled the gap in the intermediate coupling regime by using a variational path-integral method. Key ideas include:
- Integrating out phonons leads to a non-local (in time) effective electron action
- Move to **imaginary time** simplifies isolating the ground state energy
- Use of a **model action** with variational parameters \( M \) and \( \omega \)

He used the **Jensen-Feynman inequality** to derive a variational upper bound for the polaron ground state energy. Monte Carlo simulations have since validated and extended this approach.

## Why Study Polarons?

Polarons are central to understanding charge transport in materials like hybrid perovskites, 2D materials, and organic semiconductors. They affect mobility, carrier lifetimes, and device performance in photovoltaics, thermoelectrics, and optoelectronics.

In thermoelectrics, polarons influence properties like the Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity, and carrier mobility—making them essential for optimizing material performance.

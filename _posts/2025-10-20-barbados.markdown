title: We Gatherin' Science Outreach event in Barbados!

# The "We Gatherin'" Science Outreach event in Barbados!
This past September, I had the incredible opportunity to represent McGill’s Physics Outreach Committee in Barbados during the We Gatherin’ celebrations in St. James Parish. The Bellairs Research Institute hosted a full-day Science Outreach event for local schoolchildren, marking the first time that Physics Outreach and the Redpath Museum’s Education Team organized a workshop abroad.

Alongside my colleague Catherine Boisvert, and in collaboration with the Redpath Museum’s Education Team, we worked with 120 students aged 10–14. We led hands-on physics activities, from designing parachutes and building electrochemical potato batteries to constructing electric motors and compasses to explore Earth’s magnetic field. 
Each activity was designed not only to demonstrate physical principles, such as air resistance buoyancy, and Lorentz forces, but also to give students the opportunity to form hypotheses, test their own designs, identify sources of error, and iteratively refine their experiments. And their curiosity, creativity, and enthusiasm really made this an unforgettable experience.

In the morning, we started with two activities designed for younger students: the Parachute Challenge and the Potato Lamp Experiment.
In the Parachute Challenge, students worked in small teams to design and build miniature parachutes using everyday materials such as paper, string, plastic bags, and tape. The goal was to safely land a small object (in our case, marbles) from a set height while maximizing air resistance and minimizing impact speed. The session was highly hands-on: students experimented with different canopy shapes and sizes, observed the effects, and iteratively improved their designs. Through this process, they were introduced to the basic physics concepts of air resistance, gravity, and terminal velocity.
Students who completed the Parachute Challenge could then participate in the Sink or Float Activity, where they tested various everyday objects in water to predict and verify whether each would sink or float. Using a worksheet, they recorded their predictions and observations to compare outcomes. By testing out clay, they also had the chance to see how shape plays a critical role in boat design, as it directly affects buoyancy. Lastly, they tested a raw egg in both fresh and salt water to observe how the density of water influences its floating behavior (they observed first-hand how a raw-egg will sink in fresh water but would float in salt water, becasue, as the water's salt content increases, it becomes denser!).

The Potato Lamp Experiment, which also took place in the morning, was a classic demonstration of electrochemistry. Students built a simple battery using potatoes connected in series, two different metal electrodes (zinc and copper), and a small LED. As an extension, they explored how connecting multiple potato batteries in series increased the total voltage, either by measuring it with a multimeter or by observing the LED glow more brightly as more potatoes were added.
In the afternoon, we welcomed older students, aged 12 to 14. For this second part of the day, we organized the Build a Simple Compass and Simple Electric Motor activities, along with a repeat of the Potato Lamp experiment.

The Simple Electric Motor activity was an exciting demonstration of electromagnetism in action. Using enamel-coated copper wire, a small magnet, a battery, and paper clips, students built a simple electric motor capable of spinning rapidly once completed. Through this experiment, they learned how electrical energy can be converted into mechanical motion via magnetic forces. They also explored how balancing the coil, adjusting the number of wire turns, and positioning the magnet were critical in making sure that the electric motor worked. Through this activity, they gained a hands-on understanding of how an electromagnet is created and functions, while also learning the importance of precision and care when working with electrical contacts (not following the steps of the worksheet carefully usually resulted in a motor that wouldn't spin properly!).

The Build a Simple Compass activity introduced students to the concept of magnetism and the Earth's magnetic field. Using plastic bottle caps, cork disks, and sewing needles, participants created working compasses by magnetizing the needles and floating them on water using small pieces of cork or wax paper. After rubbing one end of the needle with a strong magnet in a single direction, students observed how the needle aligned itself along the north-south axis, providing a clear and engaging visualization of the Earth’s magnetic field (and they could then test it with a compass to make sure the needle was properly working). They also experimented with a large horseshoe magnet to see how brining the large horseshoes magnet close to their "homemade compass" disrupted and influenced the magnetized needle’s orientation.

I can definitely say that Physics Outreach has been the highlight of my journey in physics. Seeing students light up when a motor finally started or when their parachute design worked reminded me of what first drew me to physics: the joy of discovery, especially when science becomes something you can test, troubleshoot and make your own.

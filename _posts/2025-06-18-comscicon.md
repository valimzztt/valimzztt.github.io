title: My experience at the ComSciConCanada workshop
---

From June 27th to 29th, 2025, I had the incredible opportunity to attend the <strong>ComSciCon Canada</strong> workshop at McMaster University. As one of only 30 selected attendees, it was a unique chance to connect directly with passionate science communicators from across the country.

I spent three intense days exploring the many shapes that science communication (SciComm) can take. Often, we think of science as belonging strictly in academic settings. But in my ideal scenario, science is embedded in our everyday lives. To achieve this, we need to move beyond jargon that only those with a decade of experience understand. We need to communicate in ways that resonate with everyone.

This isn't an easy task, but attending this workshop was a pivotal moment for understanding my own strengths and weaknesses in SciComm. The three days were packed with hands-on activities; we collaborated to pitch science podcasts and even learned about science comedy as a powerful tool to make complex topics fun and accessible.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect was the diversity of the group. We were biologists, engineers, physicists, and psychologists all in one room. Witnessing that cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas was incredibly valuable and definitely helped me identify areas where my own communication skills need to grow.

In this project, I explored the **tight-binding (TB) model**—a foundational method in solid-state physics for calculating the electronic band structure of crystalline solids. The TB approach provides an intuitive picture based on **localized atomic orbitals**, and connects naturally with **Wannier functions**, which are essential in modern electronic structure analysis.

## General Formulation of the Tight-Binding Model

The tight-binding approximation begins with the assumption that near each lattice point, the full periodic **crystal Hamiltonian** \( H \) can be approximated by the atomic Hamiltonian \( H_{\text{at}} \). We use atomic orbitals \( \varphi_n(\mathbf{r}) \), eigenfunctions of \( H_{\text{at}} \), to construct the electronic states of the crystal.

$$
H_{\text{at}} \varphi_n = E_n \varphi_n \tag{10.1}
$$

In the crystal, the atomic wavefunctions ` \varphi_n(\mathbf{r}) ` overlap with those of neighboring atoms. To account for the crystal potential, we express the Hamiltonian as:

$$
H = H_{\text{at}} + \Delta U(\mathbf{r})
$$

The solution to the Schrödinger equation is approximated as a **linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO)**:

$$
\psi_m(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{\mathbf{R}_n} b_m(\mathbf{R}_n)\ \varphi_m(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{R}_n)
$$

## Bloch's Theorem

The eigenstates \( \psi \) of the crystal Hamiltonian can be written using **Bloch's theorem**:

$$
\psi(\mathbf{r}) = e^{i\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}} u(\mathbf{r})
$$

Here, \( u(\mathbf{r}) \) is periodic with the Bravais lattice. The wave vector \( \mathbf{k} \) is confined to the **first Brillouin zone**, and each state is indexed by a band \( n \). The Hamiltonian becomes diagonal in this Bloch basis:

$$
\hat{H} = \sum_{\mathbf{k}n} \varepsilon_{\mathbf{k}n} \hat{a}^\dagger_{\mathbf{k}n} \hat{a}_{\mathbf{k}n}
$$

This formalism describes electrons as **delocalized states**, extended across the crystal.

## The Tight-Binding Approach in Terms of Wannier Functions
\label{sec:method2-Wannier}

To transition to a **real-space perspective**, we use **Wannier functions (WFs)**, which are localized orbitals derived from the Fourier transform of Bloch functions. They offer an insightful framework for analyzing on-site energies and hopping terms.

Using Dirac notation, the Wannier functions \( |R_n\rangle \) in unit cell \( \mathbf{R} \) for band \( n \) are defined as:

$$
|R_n\rangle = \frac{V}{(2\pi)^3} \int_{\text{BZ}} d\mathbf{k} \ e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{R}} |c_{n\mathbf{k}}\rangle
$$

This orthonormal basis allows reconstruction of the Bloch states via:

$$
|\psi_{n\mathbf{k}}\rangle = \sum_{\mathbf{R}} e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{R}} |R_n\rangle
$$

## Generalization and Gauge Freedom

The definition of Bloch functions contains a **gauge freedom**: we can modify the phase of each Bloch function as

$$
|\tilde{\psi}_{n\mathbf{k}}\rangle = e^{i\phi_n(\mathbf{k})}|\psi_{n\mathbf{k}}\rangle
$$

This transforms the Wannier functions as:

$$
|R_{\alpha T}\rangle = \frac{V}{(2\pi)^3} \int_{\text{BZ}} d^3\mathbf{k} \ e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{T}} \sum_n U_{n\alpha}(\mathbf{k}) |\psi_{n\mathbf{k}}\rangle
$$

The indices \( \alpha \) and \( \mathbf{T} \) distinguish different Wannier orbitals in the same or different unit cells.

## Maximally Localized Wannier Functions (MLWF)

Due to gauge freedom, **conventional Wannier functions are non-unique**. Marzari and Vanderbilt (1997) proposed a **localization criterion** for constructing **Maximally Localized Wannier Functions (MLWFs)**. These are obtained by minimizing the spread functional:

$$
\Omega = \sum_n \left[ \langle w_n | r^2 | w_n \rangle - \langle w_n | \mathbf{r} | w_n \rangle^2 \right]
$$

MLWFs are spatially compact, orthonormal, and capture the crystal potential effects. They often resemble atomic orbitals (e.g., \( s, p, d \)) and bridge the gap between first-principles calculations and **tight-binding models**, allowing intuitive interpretation of electronic structure.

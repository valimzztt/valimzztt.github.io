One project I worked on involved creating Highly Localized Wannier Functions using Density Functional Theory. The Wannier functions are a complete set of orthogonal functions used in solid-state physics. They were introduced by Gregory Wannier in 1937.Wannier functions are the localized molecular orbitals of crystalline systems.

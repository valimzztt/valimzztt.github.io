## What Can We Learn from Time-Resolved Terahertz Spectroscopy?

This presentation is a way for me to showcase the core ideas and impact of my research in a way that’s as approachable as possible. First of all, my research is all about how light interacts with matter, a fundamental process that underpins technologies like solar cells, sensors, and LEDs.
But not all light is the same. To understand the kind of light I work with, we need to start by looking at the electromagnetic spectrum — a map of all the different “types” of light that exist, from radio waves to X-rays.

For a long time, a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum of light remained largely unexplored—we call it the terahertz (THz) gap. Lying between microwaves and infrared light, this gap existed because we lacked suitable sources and detectors to generate and detect light in this frequency range. As a result, we were blind to many processes happening at these frequencies.

Recent advances in ultrafast laser physics have changed this, opening the field of THz spectroscopy, which uses electromagnetic fields in this frequency range to probe and control material properties. 
What makes THz radiation particularly valuable is that its energy scale matches many fundamental low-energy processes in physical systems. For example, when light is absorbed by a material, its energy is transferred to negatively charged carriers, called electrons. Normally, electrons are tightly bound in the material. But when they absorb enough energy, they break free, can move around, and start to interact with their surroundings. Many of these interactions — especially those between electrons and lattice vibrations (phonons) — naturally occur at terahertz frequencies, making THz radiation the ideal probe to study them. This includes processes like carrier scattering, energy dissipation, and even polaron formation, where electrons become temporarily coupled to distortions in the atomic lattice. THz spectroscopy is thus perfectly suited to explore these subtle yet critical dynamics.

Time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy (TRTS) is a powerful optical pump–THz probe technique used to study the ultrafast dynamics of charge carriers in materials. Unlike conventional electrical or optical probes, TRTS is sensitive to low-energy excitations in the far-infrared region (0.1–10 THz), making it uniquely suited for observing free carrier motion, polarons, excitons, and phonons on sub-picosecond timescales.

How Does TRTS Work? In TRTS, a short optical pump pulse excites the sample, typically promoting electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. A time-delayed single-cycle THz pulse is then directed onto the sample to probe how this excitation modifies its dielectric response. By varying the delay between pump and probe, one can construct a time-dependent picture of carrier generation, relaxation, and recombination dynamics.

In my own research, I used TRTS in reflection geometry on CdTe, a direct bandgap semiconductor. An 800 nm pump pulse—matching the bandgap energy of CdTe—excites the electrons, and the resulting changes in the reflected THz pulse are recorded.

## Raw Data and Signal Processing

The measurement is typically performed using a lock-in detection scheme. A mechanical chopper modulates the pump beam at a frequency synchronized to a sub-multiple of the laser repetition rate (often 1/4), allowing for differential measurements of the electric field with and without photoexcitation.

This gives two sets of time-domain waveforms:

- `E_ref(t)`: Reference THz field without pump  
- `E_pump(t)`: THz field after excitation

The differential electric field then given by $$ \Delta E(t) = E_{\text{pump}}(t) - E_{\text{ref}}(t) $$ 

What information can be extracted from THz-TRTS? By fitting the reflectivity data to a Drude model, you can get information on the scattering time tau and the plasma frequency. 
But what exactly is the plasma frequency? To understand that, we need to refer plasmons, which can be described in the classical picture as an oscillation of free electron density
with respect to the fixed positive ions in a metal. To visualize a plasma oscillation, imagine a
cube of metal placed in an external electric field pointing to the right. Electrons will move to
the left side (uncovering positive ions on the right side) until they cancel the field inside the
metal. If the electric field is removed, the electrons move to the right, repelled by each other
and attracted to the positive ions left bare on the right side. They oscillate back and forth at
the plasma frequency until the energy is lost in some kind of resistance or damping. Plasmons
are a quantization of this kind of oscillation.


From this, one can extract the **photoinduced change in reflectivity** \( \Delta R / R \), or compute the **complex conductivity** via Fourier transform and model fitting. So first you measure time-domain THz signals (with and without pump), then you Fourier transform to obtain complex reflectivity or transmission.  

## Modeling with the Drude Model

The Drude model provides a classical framework for understanding free carrier absorption in the THz regime. The frequency-dependent complex conductivity is given by:

$$
\sigma(\omega) = \frac{n e^2 \tau}{m^* (1 - i \omega \tau)}
$$

Where $$n$$ is the carrier density, $$\tau$$ the scattering time, $$ m^* $$ the effective mass, and $$ e $$ the elementary charge.

By fitting the measured THz reflectivity or transmission to this model, you can extract:

- **Carrier lifetime / scattering time** $$ \tau $$. 
- **Plasma frequency** $$ \omega_p = \sqrt{\frac{n e^2}{\varepsilon_0 m^*}} $$

## What Is the Plasma Frequency?

The plasma frequency represents the natural oscillation rate of a free electron gas relative to the ionic background. In the classical picture, when electrons are displaced from equilibrium, the restoring force due to positive ions leads to collective oscillations. This frequency is a direct indicator of free carrier density and mobility in the system.

A high plasma frequency implies a high density of mobile charges or a low effective mass—both desirable in materials for photovoltaics or high-speed electronics.

TRTS isn't limited to simple Drude analysis. Depending on the system, more advanced models are needed:

- **Drude–Smith model**: For backscattering-dominated transport (e.g., nanocrystalline materials)  
- **Drude–Lorentz model**: For resonances due to phonons or polarons  

In the case of CdTe, there is a strong phonon at 5THz, 
In my work, I am exploring how to incorporate polaron dynamics into these models to understand how carrier–phonon interactions evolve after photoexcitation.


# Using the Drude–Lorentz Model in THz Spectroscopy

In time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy (TRTS), understanding the complex dielectric response of a material is crucial. For materials like CdTe that exhibit strong optical phonons in the THz range (e.g., at ~5 THz), the standard Drude model is insufficient. This is where the **Drude–Lorentz model** comes in. In fact, while the Drude model describes the response of **free carriers** (electrons or holes), it neglects bound charge resonances such as optical phonons, which strongly affect the THz dielectric function in many semiconductors and polar materials. CdTe, for example, has a **longitudinal optical (LO) phonon near 5 THz**, which couples to the electric field of the THz probe. To model this accurately, we need to add a **Lorentz oscillator** to represent the phonon contribution.


##  Drude–Lorentz Dielectric Function

The frequency-dependent complex dielectric function is given by:

$$
\varepsilon(\omega) = \varepsilon_\infty - \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2 + i\omega/\tau} + \sum_j \frac{S_j \omega_{j}^2}{\omega_{j}^2 - \omega^2 - i\omega\Gamma_j}
$$

Where:
- $$ \varepsilon_\infty $$: High-frequency dielectric constant (background permittivity)
- $$ \omega_p $$: Plasma frequency of the free carriers
- $$ \tau $$: Carrier scattering time
- $$ \omega_j $$: Resonance frequency of the \( j \)-th phonon (e.g., 5 THz)
- $$ \Gamma_j $$: Damping coefficient of the phonon
- $$ S_j $$: Oscillator strength

For CdTe, the fitting model included 
1. **One Drude term**:
   - $$\omega_p$$: from carrier density  
   - $$\tau$$: from carrier mobility or extracted via fitting

2. **One Lorentz oscillator** for the LO phonon at ~5 THz:
   - $$\omega_0 \approx 5\,\text{THz}$$  
   - $$\Gamma$$: phonon linewidth (fit from data)  
   - $$S$$: strength (fit)

3. Fit the result to the Drude–Lorentz model to extract:
   - **Scattering time** $$\tau$$  
   - **Carrier density** via $$\omega_p$$  
   - **Phonon parameters**: $$\omega_0$$, $$\Gamma$$, $$S$$

## Why does it matter?
Because many of the technologies we rely on — from solar panels to energy-efficient LEDs — depend on how efficiently charge carriers move. If we understand the microscopic dynamics that limit this motion, we can design better materials and devices.
In my research, I use TRTS to study semiconductors that are important for clean energy. One material I focus on is cadmium telluride (CdTe) — a leading thin-film photovoltaic material. By probing how electrons behave in CdTe after photoexcitation, I aim to understand what limits its efficiency at a microscopic level.
I also study oxide materials like cerium dioxide (ceria), which are promising for photocatalysis — meaning they can help drive chemical reactions using light. These materials often have complex interactions between electrons and the lattice, and THz spectroscopy allows us to explore them on their natural timescales.
The insights we gain from THz spectroscopy help guide the development of next-generation optoelectronic materials and devices — smarter, faster, and more sustainable technologies for the future.

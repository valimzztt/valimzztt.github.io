This presentation is a way for me to showcase the core ideas and impact of my research in a way that’s as approachable as possible. First of all, my research is all about how light interacts with matter, a fundamental process that underpins technologies like solar cells, sensors, and LEDs.
But not all light is the same. To understand the kind of light I work with, we need to start by looking at the electromagnetic spectrum — a map of all the different “types” of light that exist, from radio waves to X-rays.

For a long time, a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum of light remained largely unexplored—we call it the terahertz (THz) gap. Lying between microwaves and infrared light, this gap existed because we lacked suitable sources and detectors to generate and detect light in this frequency range. As a result, we were blind to many processes happening at these frequencies.

Recent advances in ultrafast laser physics have changed this, opening the field of THz spectroscopy, which uses electromagnetic fields in this frequency range to probe and control material properties. 
What makes THz radiation particularly valuable is that its energy scale matches many fundamental low-energy processes in physical systems. For example, when light is absorbed by a material, its energy is transferred to negatively charged carriers, called electrons. Normally, electrons are tightly bound in the material. But when they absorb enough energy, they break free, can move around, and start to interact with their surroundings. Many of these interactions — especially those between electrons and lattice vibrations (phonons) — naturally occur at terahertz frequencies, making THz radiation the ideal probe to study them. This includes processes like carrier scattering, energy dissipation, and even polaron formation, where electrons become temporarily coupled to distortions in the atomic lattice. THz spectroscopy is thus perfectly suited to explore these subtle yet critical dynamics.

However, these processes happen on ultrafast timescales. This is where Time-Resolved Terahertz Spectroscopy (TRTS) comes into play—a powerful technique that I use in my research to track the dynamics of charge carriers, such as electrons, with exceptional time resolution. 

Here is how it works: First, we shine an ultrafast laser pulse onto the material, exciting charge carriers and inducing changes in the electronic properties of the material. This clearly modifies the way the material absorbs and interacts with THz radiation. We then send a terahertz probe pulse through the sample, with the transmitted THz beam carrying crucial information about the changes that occurred in the material and how the excited electrons responded to photoexcitation.

We then send a terahertz probe pulse through the sample, with the transmitted THz beam carrying crucial information about the changes that occurred in the material and how the excited electrons responded to photoexcitation. 
The THz probe pulse, arriving shorting after the excitation, contains low-energy electromagnetic fields that interact with the newly generated free carriers. In fact, the THz electric field going through the material, accelerates the free electrons, their motion in response to the THz field contributes to a transient current and this current then modifies the transmitted THz pulse. What is of interest in the case of materials science, is that the response we can observe depends on the carrier properties: particularly, the THz probe is sensitive to the carrier density, the mobility (how easily carriers can accelerate and move through the material) as well as scattering mechanisms that tells you how effective the charge carriers move. In short, the THz pulse “feels” the presence of the carriers, because they collectively screen the electric field and absorb energy. 

By varying the time delay between these two pulses and analyzing the transmitted THz signal for each delay, we can reconstruct the dynamics of electrons in the material after laser excitation—almost like an ultrafast camera just for electrons. 

In my research, I use time-resolved THz spectroscopy to investigate semiconductors that are relevant for clean energy applications. One material I study is cadmium telluride (CdTe), a widely used thin-film photovoltaic material. Understanding how charge carriers behave in CdTe after light absorption can help us identify the microscopic processes that limit efficiency in solar cells. I also explore oxide materials like cerium dioxide (ceria), which are promising for photocatalysis. These systems often exhibit complex interactions between electrons and the lattice, and THz spectroscopy allows us to probe these interactions on the timescales where they naturally occur
Why does this matter? Many of the technologies we rely on, such as solar panels or energy-efficient LEDs, depend on how efficiently charge carriers move within. The insights gained from THz spectroscopy therefore drives the development of the next generation of optoelectronic devices, such as photovoltaics and LEDs, as well as materials used as photocatalysts, which are materials that change the rate of a chemical reaction on exposure to light.

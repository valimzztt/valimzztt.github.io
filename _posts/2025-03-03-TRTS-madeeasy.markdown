This presentation is a way for me to showcase the core ideas and impact of my research in a way that’s as approachable as possible. First of all, my research is all about how light interacts with matter, a fundamental process that underpins technologies like solar cells, sensors, and LEDs.
But not all light is the same. To understand the kind of light I work with, we need to start by looking at the electromagnetic spectrum — a map of all the different “types” of light that exist, from radio waves to X-rays.

For a long time, a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum of light remained largely unexplored—we call it the terahertz (THz) gap. Lying between microwaves and infrared light, this gap existed because we lacked suitable sources and detectors to generate and detect light in this frequency range. As a result, we were blind to many processes happening at these frequencies.

Recent advances in ultrafast laser physics have changed this, opening the field of THz spectroscopy, which uses electromagnetic fields in this frequency range to probe and control material properties. 
What makes THz radiation particularly valuable is that its energy scale matches many fundamental low-energy processes in physical systems. For example, when light is absorbed by a material, its energy is transferred to negatively charged carriers, called electrons. Normally, electrons are tightly bound in the material. But when they absorb enough energy, they break free, can move around, and start to interact with their surroundings. Many of these interactions — especially those between electrons and lattice vibrations (phonons) — naturally occur at terahertz frequencies, making THz radiation the ideal probe to study them. This includes processes like carrier scattering, energy dissipation, and even polaron formation, where electrons become temporarily coupled to distortions in the atomic lattice. THz spectroscopy is thus perfectly suited to explore these subtle yet critical dynamics.

However, these processes happen on ultrafast timescales. This is where Time-Resolved Terahertz Spectroscopy (TRTS) comes into play—a powerful technique that I use in my research to track the dynamics of charge carriers, such as electrons, with exceptional time resolution. 

Here’s how it works: First, we shine an ultrafast laser pulse onto the material, exciting charge carriers — primarily electrons — which begin to move through the material. This excitation modifies the way the material absorbs and interacts with THz radiation.
Shortly after, a terahertz (THz) probe pulse arrives. This pulse contains low-energy electromagnetic fields that interact with the newly generated free carriers. The THz electric field accelerates the electrons, and their motion produces a transient current. This current, in turn, alters the transmitted THz pulse, both in amplitude and phase.
What’s particularly useful for materials science is that this response depends on the properties of the carriers — including their density, their mobility (that is, how easily they can accelerate and move through the material), and the scattering mechanisms that determine how effectively they can travel. In short, the THz pulse “feels” the presence of these carriers because they collectively screen the electric field and absorb energy. As a result, the transmitted THz signal carries crucial information about the changes that occurred in the material and how the excited electrons responded to photoexcitation.

By varying the time delay between these two pulses and analyzing the transmitted THz signal for each delay, we can reconstruct the dynamics of electrons in the material after laser excitation—almost like an ultrafast camera just for electrons. 

Why does this matter?
Because many of the technologies we rely on — from solar panels to energy-efficient LEDs — depend on how efficiently charge carriers move. If we understand the microscopic dynamics that limit this motion, we can design better materials and devices.
In my research, I use TRTS to study semiconductors that are important for clean energy. One material I focus on is cadmium telluride (CdTe) — a leading thin-film photovoltaic material. By probing how electrons behave in CdTe after photoexcitation, I aim to understand what limits its efficiency at a microscopic level.
I also study oxide materials like cerium dioxide (ceria), which are promising for photocatalysis — meaning they can help drive chemical reactions using light. These materials often have complex interactions between electrons and the lattice, and THz spectroscopy allows us to explore them on their natural timescales.
The insights we gain from THz spectroscopy help guide the development of next-generation optoelectronic materials and devices — smarter, faster, and more sustainable technologies for the future.

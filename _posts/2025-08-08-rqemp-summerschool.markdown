title: Summer School for Advanced Materials Science and Engineering
---

It was a pleasure to be part of the RQÉMP student committee that organized the Summer School for Advanced Materials Science and Engineering. This three-day event brought together graduate and undergraduate students from across Quebec and created many opportunities for meaningful discussion. The program featured scientific talks from a variety of disciplines, along with student presentations where participants had the opportunity to showcase their research.
I particularly enjoyed the hands-on workshop on sustainability and life-cycle assessment led by a Soprema representative, as well as the science communication session, which inspired everyone to reflect on their role as science communicators and explore how to share their research with a broader audience.

## ðŸ§ª Generating Third-Harmonic Light from a Femtosecond Ti:Sapphire Laser

This week, my task has been to set up a pump line, using a nonlinear crystal-based THG kit, that can convert the 800 nm fundamental pump pulse from the Ti:Sapphire oscillator we have into UV light. 

Third-harmonic generation (THG) is a nonlinear optical process in which photons from a fundamental laser beam combine to produce new photons at three times the original frequency. In our case, we used a Ti:sapphire oscillator emitting pulses at 800â€¯nm and aimed to generate light at 266â€¯nm (UV) through THG.

The THG process involves two steps:

1. **Second-harmonic generation (SHG):**  
   `Ï‰ + Ï‰ â†’ 2Ï‰` â†’ converts 800â€¯nm light into 400â€¯nm

2. **Sum-frequency generation (SFG):**  
   `Ï‰ + 2Ï‰ â†’ 3Ï‰` â†’ mixes 800â€¯nm and 400â€¯nm to produce 266â€¯nm

### ðŸ§± Experimental Setup

We used a pre-aligned THG kit provided by **EKSMA Optics**, which includes:

- **Type I BBO crystal** for SHG (800â€¯nm â†’ 400â€¯nm),
- **Calcite group velocity delay plate** to synchronize 800â€¯nm and 400â€¯nm pulses,
- **Dual-wavelength waveplate** to match polarization for THG,
- **Second BBO crystal** for sum-frequency generation (800â€¯nm + 400â€¯nm â†’ 266â€¯nm),
- **UV filters and harmonic separators** to isolate the 266â€¯nm beam.

The Type I BB

1. **Generate 400â€¯nm Light:**  
   The first BBO crystal was rotated to maximize SHG. A color card and spectrometer confirmed successful generation.

2. **Introduce Group Delay Compensation:**  
   A calcite plate was inserted in the 800â€¯nm beam path to delay the faster pulse and restore temporal overlap. Tilting the plate while monitoring UV output was crucial.

3. **Match Polarizations:**  
   The dual-wavelength waveplate was adjusted to set the proper polarization conditions for THG.

4. **Optimize THG Crystal Angle:**  
   The second BBO crystal was rotated until a clear UV signal at 266â€¯nm was observed using a fluorescence card.

## 
To be honest, I encountered a lot of challenges as the initial attempts showed no UV output. This was due to the fact that 

- Initial attempts showed no UV output due to:
  - Temporal walk-off between 800â€¯nm and 400â€¯nm pulses,
  - Polarization mismatch in the waveplate,
  - Incorrect crystal angle for phase matching.

- Careful tuning of all optical elements was necessary.

### ðŸ”¬ Results

Once aligned, a stable UV beam at **266â€¯nm** was observed. Verification was done via:

- UV-sensitive fluorescence card,
- UV-enhanced photodiode (for approximate power),
- Spectrometer (peak at 266â€¯nm confirmed).

Estimated output: **~10â€“100â€¯ÂµW**, consistent and tunable.

### ðŸ§  Reflections

This experiment highlighted the importance of phase matching, temporal synchronization, and polarization in nonlinear optics. With proper alignment and diagnostics, even weak THG signals can be stabilized â€” enabling a UV source suitable for pump-probe spectroscopy and ultrafast science.

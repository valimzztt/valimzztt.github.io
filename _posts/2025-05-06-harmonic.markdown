As part of my Master thesis project, I worked on a setup that’s been both conceptually very interesting but also technically unforgiving: generating ultraviolet (UV) light from the 800 nm output of our femtosecond Ti:Sapphire laser via third-harmonic generation (THG). While I had learnt about THG in my Nonlinear Optics course, seeing it working experimentally, especially at such short wavelengths, was a different challenge entirely.

At its core, THG is a nonlinear optical process where three photons of frequency \( \omega \) combine to form a single photon at \( 3\omega \). Since our setup uses a Ti:Sapphire laser centered at 800 nm, the goal was to generate UV light at 266 nm. This isn’t done in one step, but rather as a sort of cascaded process involving second-order nonlinearities:

$$
\text{Step 1 (SHG)}:\quad \omega + \omega \rightarrow 2\omega \quad \text{(800 nm → 400 nm)} \\
$$
$$
\text{Step 2 (SFG)}:\quad \omega + 2\omega \rightarrow 3\omega \quad \text{(800 nm + 400 nm → 266 nm)}
$$

Although THG is formally a third-order ($$ \chi^{(3)} $$) process, in practice it's often implemented via two successive second-order ($$ \chi^{(2)}$$) interactions in phase-matched birefringent crystals, which is what we attempted here.

### Building the Setup
Going now to the setup: what optical components do you need to generate THG? Well, all the components we bought were designed to match exactly the pulse width of 35 fs of the laser we have. These included two 35fs-tailored BBO crystals and a series of elements tailored for cascaded frequency conversion. The first BBO crystal is responsible for second-harmonic generation (SHG). Rotating it gradually, I monitored the output with a spectrometer and a color card — eventually spotting the violet hue characteristic of 400 nm light. That part was relatively smooth.

The next step was much trickier. Because the 800 nm and 400 nm pulses travel at different group velocities, they quickly slip out of sync inside the second BBO crystal. To compensate for this temporal walk-off, I introduced a calcite delay plate into the 800 nm beam path. It sounds simple enough, but achieving overlap requires minute tilt adjustments and a lot of patience (which I was very close to losing).

And this is where the real difficulty begins.

Nonlinear optics only works efficiently when the phase-matching condition

$$
\vec{k}_{3\omega} = \vec{k}_{\omega} + \vec{k}_{2\omega}
$$

is satisfied. The generated UV wave must remain in phase with the nonlinear polarization driving it. If it slips even slightly out of phase, the newly generated light begins to interfere destructively with itself, and the conversion efficiency collapses.

In BBO, achieving this condition depends sensitively on sub-degree crystal angle precision, polarization alignment, and spatial *and* temporal overlap within femtoseconds. Because we are working with 35 fs pulses, there is almost no room for error. The 800 nm and 400 nm pulses separate inside the crystal within tens of microns. If they do not overlap both spatially and temporally, the sum-frequency process simply does not occur.

That is why this setup felt so unforgiving. A half-degree tilt of the BBO crystal? The UV disappears. A slightly imperfect polarization? Gone. A tiny mismatch in delay? Nothing.
After going back through every element, such as adjusting the calcite delay plate by fractions of a millimeter, re-optimizing the first BBO crystal, rechecking polarization alignment, I slowly scanned the second crystal angle again.

That moment felt disproportionally rewarding compared to the few microwatts of power it produced. Because reaching those 5.5 mW required satisfying multiple constraints simultaneously, since I was basically dealing with a multidimensional alignment problem where everything has to be right at the same time.

With 500 mW at 800 nm, extracting only ~1% efficiency might not sound impressive. But when you consider how tightly phase matching constrains the interaction length, and how quickly ultrafast pulses walk off inside birefringent crystals,  even that small efficiency represents a win.

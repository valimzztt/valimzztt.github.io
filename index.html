    <p>Welcome! I’m a Master’s student in Physics at McGill University, working in the <a href="https://thz.lab.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultrafast THz Spectroscopy Laboratory</a> under the supervision of Professor David Cooke. In the lab, I work as an experimental physicist studying charge-carrier dynamics and polaron formation in quantum materials using ultrabroadband time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy.</p>

    <p>Alongside my experimental work, I have a strong computational background. I work on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for multi-electron systems and develop classical and quantum algorithms to study material properties relevant to energy and quantum technologies. My training in both Physics and Computer Science allows me to move comfortably between theory, simulation, and experiment.</p>
    
    <p>I’m particularly interested in understanding how fundamental quantum phenomena translate into measurable behavior, and how we can use computational tools and machine learning to model, predict, and better control complex physical systems.</p>
    
    <p>Beyond research, I’m actively involved in science outreach. I help organize public talks and scientific events at McGill and through the Advanced Materials community of Quebec, with the goal of making advanced research more accessible and creating spaces where scientists can share their work with broader audiences. I’m also especially passionate about creating opportunities
       for experts to share their research in accessible ways, as well as designing hands-on activities and events that inspire curiosity and a love for science among young learners. </p>

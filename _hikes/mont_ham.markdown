# Mont Ham, Québec
This was my very first hike in Quebec, and I picked it with one goal in mind: to finally witness the famous eastern Canadian fall foliage. Mount Ham, located in Saint-Joseph-de-Ham-Sud (just a short drive from Ham-Nord), is nestled in the Eastern Townships — a region I hadn’t explored much before.  

At 713 metres above sea level, it's one of the tallest peaks in the lowlands of the Appalachian range, which makes it a great choice for a half-day hike with rewarding views. While the terrain around Montreal isn’t exactly known for dramatic elevation changes, and I generally tend to gravitate toward more alpine landscapes, but I found myself pleasantly surprised.

The trail was peaceful, with bursts of colour starting to show on the trees, and the summit offered a panoramic view over the rolling hills of the Townships. It wasn’t the most challenging or jaw-dropping hike I’ve done, but something about being surrounded by the stillness of the forest in a new part of the province made it feel memorable. I’m already looking forward to do some more hikes in the area next fall!

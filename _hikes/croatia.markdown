I was spending my time with a friend in Crotia, when we realized we both really fancied a hike. But are there any big mountains in Croatia? Croatia is not really known for its mountains and only few tourists visit the local mountains, which is a great pity. Croatian mountains are beautiful. The highest point of Croatia Dinara was named after the Dinaric Mountains, a 700-kilometer-long mountain range system that spans over almost all the countries of former Yugoslavia. The mountains are wonderful and offer amazing views. The hike to the highest point of Croatia isn’t an exception. To reach the peak isn’t a challenge technically but it can get very hot there so don’t forget to bring enough water, especially in the summer!

This was by far one of the most satisfying and spontaneous adventures I‚Äôve done in Quebec! The idea to bike from Montr√©al to Ottawa had been lingering in the back of my mind for a while, and one weekend, I finally decided to go for it.  

The route follows mostly well-maintained bike paths and quiet country roads, weaving through small towns, riverside stretches, and farmland. I split the trip over two days, which made it manageable and surprisingly enjoyable ‚Äî even with bit of headwind.  

Along the way, stretched by the riverside, we soaked in the feeling of covering real distance. Crossing into Ontario and seeing signs for Ottawa was such a rewarding moment.  

Rolling into the capital on two wheels felt like a genuine achievement. Tired, yes ‚Äî but more than anything, energized. There's something uniquely freeing about watching the landscape shift slowly over a long ride, and I‚Äôd absolutely do it again (maybe with a detour next time!).

Here is the Google Maps with the itinerary.

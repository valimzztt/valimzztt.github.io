Throughout my academic journey, I have become passionate about Outreach. As the Public Talks Coordinator of the Physics Department, I had the chance to organize the monthly Public Talks, aimed at a general audience. This has been an extraordinary opportunity to connect students, general public and professors, as well as broaden my own knowledge and network. If you are curious about the topics of the talk, I have listed the talks I have organized  <a href="/outreach/public_talks" class="button">here</a>.

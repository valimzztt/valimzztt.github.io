Welcome! I am currently a Master's student in Physics at McGill University, working in the [Ultrafast THz Spectroscopy Laboratory](https://thz.lab.mcgill.ca/), under the supervision of Professor David Cooke. My research focuses on ultrabroad THz spectroscopy to investigate the dynamics of polarons in halide perovskites.
I am passionate about understanding quantum materials and their applications in optoelectronic devices, with a strong interest in contributing to sustainable technologies.
Feel free to explore this site to learn more about my research, publications, and ongoing projects!

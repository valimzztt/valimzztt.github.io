    <p>Welcome! I am currently a Master's student in Physics at McGill University, working in the <a href="https://thz.lab.mcgill.ca/">Ultrafast THz Spectroscopy Laboratory</a>, under the supervision of Professor David Cooke. My research focuses on ultrabroad THz spectroscopy to investigate the dynamics of polarons in halide perovskites.</p>
    <p>I am passionate about understanding quantum materials and their applications in optoelectronic devices, with a strong interest in contributing to sustainable technologies.</p>
    <p>Feel free to explore this site to learn more about my research, publications, and ongoing projects!</p>
